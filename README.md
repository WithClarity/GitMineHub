# GitMineHub

**GitMineHub** is a collaborative Minecraft build tool designed to streamline the process of map creation and ensure secure version control. With GitMineHub, multiple builders can work on the same map simultaneously without the risk of griefing, thanks to an integrated approval system and change detection.

## Features

- **Version Control**: Uses Git to track and manage changes to the Minecraft map.
- **3D Viewer**: Visualize map changes using a WebGL-based 3D viewer. Changes are highlighted, and unchanged blocks are greyed out.
- **Change Detection**: Compare different map versions to detect and highlight modifications.
- **Approval System**: Web interface for reviewing and approving changes before they are merged into the main map.
- **Security**: Authentication and authorization to ensure only authorized users can make changes. Regular security audits and secure coding practices.
- **Linux Server Hosting**: Hosted on a secure Linux server with proper security measures including firewalls, SSL/TLS, and regular updates.

## Development Steps

1. **Initial Setup**: Configure the Git repository and secure Linux server.
2. **3D Viewer Development**: Build the 3D viewer to visualize the Minecraft maps and highlight changes.
3. **Version Control Integration**: Implement Git workflows for managing map versions and changes.
4. **Web Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for reviewing and approving changes, with robust authentication and authorization.
5. **Testing and Refinement**: Conduct thorough testing with a small user group, gather feedback, and make necessary refinements.
6. **Deployment and Maintenance**: Deploy the final version on the server and set up continuous monitoring and maintenance.
